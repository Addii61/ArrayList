This is a Java program that demonstrates the use of an ArrayList, a dynamic array in Java, with various operations such as adding, removing, getting, setting, modifying, and iterating through its elements. The program consists of two classes, Array1 and TestArrayList1.

Array1 Class
The Array1 class defines methods for various ArrayList operations:

add(): Adds three integers (1, 2, 3) to the ArrayList and prints its contents.
remove(): Removes an element at a specified index (index 1) from the ArrayList.
get(): Retrieves and prints the value at a specified index (index 0) from the ArrayList.
set(): Sets the value at a specified index (index 0) to a new value (5) and prints the modified ArrayList.
modify(): Adds a new value (7) to the beginning of the ArrayList.
size(): Prints the size of the ArrayList.
loop(): Iterates through the ArrayList and prints each element.
TestArrayList1 Class
The TestArrayList1 class is the main class, and its main method demonstrates the use of the Array1 class by creating an instance of Array1 and invoking the methods to showcase the ArrayList operations.

To run this program, execute the main method in the TestArrayList1 class.

Usage
Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g., javac TestArrayList1.java).
Run the program by executing the compiled TestArrayList1 class (e.g., java TestArrayList1).
Output
You will see the output of the various ArrayList operations as described in the comments of the code. For example:
[1, 2, 3]
1
[5, 2, 3]
2
3
7
